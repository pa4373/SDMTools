Tools for Software Development Methods, Fall 2015
=================================================

It's a collection of utilities for the software development methods course. I developed them mainly because I don't want to be overwhelmed by a bunch of emails or stuck in the lab, where I am supposed to be.

The project is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.4+ using "File > New > Project From Version Control > GitHub"

To compile without IDE, consult Gradle docs: [https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide)
